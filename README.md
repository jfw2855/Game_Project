# Game_Project
This is a game project that I created during the GA SEI program. 


## Idea 1: Chess Replica
- make a two player game of chess
- thinking this might be complicated?


## Idea 2: Wordle Replica
- Create a word guessing game
- 1. On the homescreen, have the option to guess a 4 or 5 letter word
- 2. play screen: show a grid of boxes 
- 3. the grid row will be based on if it's a 4 or 5 letter word
- 4. have a column of 6 rows to allow the player chances to guess the word
- 5. The player will enter a valid word (a db to track if word is valid?)
- 6. The letters will either turn grey, green or gold.
- 7. grey for a letter not in word, green if the letter is in the word, and gold if the letter is in the correct position of the word to guess.
- 8. if the player guesses the word correctly, the screen will display a message saying "correct guess! The word was : ______"
- 9. if the player does not get the word correct after the 6th try, the screen will display "tough luck! the word was : ______" [can even customize the message based on how many letters were guessed correctly]
- 10. Buttons will also show in the endgame message if the player would like to return to the homescreen or play another round


## Idea 3: What's the Next Line?
- A next lyric guessing game
- 1. Homescreen - display title of game and description, will have a dropdown box of genres to pick from (rock, pop, indie, etc.)
- 2. Playscreen - once player selects genre from dropdown, a music video will play for a few seconds
- 3. The video and sound will then stop and a dropdown will appear with the message, "what's the next line?"
- 4. a player will then have to choose the next lyric of the song
- 5. once the player makes a selection, the song will play for another second or so to sing the correct lyric
- 6. if the player guesses the correct line, a "correct" sound will play and the screen will display " you got it right!" 
- 7. if the player guesses wrong, a "wrong" sound will play and the screen will display "That wasn't it..."
- 8. In the message box, there will be buttons to either go back to homescreen or go to next song
- 9. If player continues to play the game, their score will be tracked and will display at the end of the game
- 10. endgame screen - Displays player's score and a message saying how well they did
- 11. There will also be a home screen button to return to the homescreen if the player would like to try another genre
