# What's the Next Line?
#### This is a game project that I created during the GA SEI program. 

- How well do you know songs from the 90s? Take the challenge with a friend to see how well you know songs from the decade!! 



## What's the Next Line? - Breakdown
- A next lyric guessing game
- 1. Homescreen - display title of game and description, will have a start button to play the game
- 2. Playscreen - once user selects play button, a music video will play for a few seconds
- 3. The video and sound will then stop and a dropdown will appear with the message, "what's the next line?"
- 4. player 1 will then have to choose the next lyric of the song
- 5. once player 1 makes a selection, the song will play for another second or so to sing the correct lyric
- 6. if player 1 guesses the correct line, a "correct" sound will play and the screen will display " you got it right!" 
- 7. if the player guesses wrong, a "wrong" sound will play and the screen will display "That wasn't it..."
- 8. the song will continue to allow player 2 to make their selection for the next prompt
- 9. Once both players make their guesses for one song, the game will switch to another song for players to repeat the process
- 10. The score for both players will be tracked for each song 
- 11. endgame screen - After a few songs (3-4) Displays both scores and a message saying who won
- 12. There will also be a home screen button to return to the homescreen if the player would like to try another genre
